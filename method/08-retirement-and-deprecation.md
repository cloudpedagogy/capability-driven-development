# Retirement and Deprecation

_Status: Draft_

---

## Purpose of This Step

This step defines how AI-enabled systems are **retired, deprecated, replaced, or withdrawn** in a responsible and capability-aligned manner.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- systems do not outlive their legitimacy, context, or capability intent
- withdrawal does not undermine trust, accountability, or institutional memory
- responsibility is maintained through end-of-life decisions
- risk does not accumulate silently in legacy systems

In Capability-Driven Development, retirement is not an afterthought.  
It is a **designed phase of the system lifecycle**.

---

## Why Retirement Must Be Designed

Many AI-enabled systems persist because:
- no one is explicitly responsible for ending them
- replacement feels riskier than continuation
- legacy systems become embedded in practice
- accountability for withdrawal is unclear

This leads to systems that:
- no longer reflect current values or capability priorities
- accumulate unmanaged ethical and governance risk
- are relied upon despite known limitations
- are difficult to defend when scrutinised

CDD treats unmanaged persistence as a **capability and governance failure**.

---

## What Retirement and Deprecation Cover

This step addresses:

- when a system should be retired or replaced
- how deprecation is communicated and managed
- how capability is preserved during transition
- how data, records, and accountability are handled
- how institutional learning is retained

It applies both to:
- full system shutdown
- partial withdrawal or scope reduction
- replacement by a new system or process

---

## Relationship to Earlier Steps

Retirement and deprecation are informed by:

- **Capability intent**  
  Whether the system still supports the capabilities it was designed to serve.

- **Human–AI boundaries**  
  Whether boundaries remain appropriate or defensible.

- **Ethics, equity, and risk**  
  Whether harms, inequities, or risks have become unacceptable.

- **Governance and oversight**  
  Whether accountability and review remain viable.

- **Evaluation and monitoring**  
  Evidence that the system no longer performs acceptably in context.

Retirement decisions should be grounded in documented evaluation, not sudden reaction.

---

## Triggers for Retirement or Deprecation

Common triggers include:

- changes in legal, ethical, or regulatory context
- persistent misalignment with capability intent
- emergence of unacceptable risks or inequities
- inability to govern or oversee the system effectively
- replacement by a more appropriate approach
- organisational or contextual change

Retirement should be seen as a **responsible response**, not a failure.

## Core Design Questions

Designers and institutions should be able to answer the following questions.

### Capability impact
- What capabilities will be lost, preserved, or strengthened by retiring the system?
- Are users dependent on the system in ways that require transition support?
- What alternative practices or systems will replace its function?

### Responsibility and accountability
- Who is responsible for the retirement decision?
- How is accountability maintained after shutdown?
- How are past decisions or outputs handled if later challenged?

### Transition and communication
- How will users and stakeholders be informed?
- Is deprecation gradual or immediate?
- What support is provided during transition?

### Data, records, and traceability
- What data must be retained, archived, or deleted?
- How long must records remain accessible for accountability?
- How is privacy respected during and after retirement?

### Learning and reflection
- What should be learned from this system’s lifecycle?
- How are lessons documented and shared?
- How does this inform future capability-driven design?

## Common Failure Modes at This Stage

Typical retirement failures include:

- leaving systems operational “just in case”
- removing systems without preserving accountability records
- failing to support users through transition
- losing institutional memory of why decisions were made
- repeating the same design mistakes in replacement systems

CDD treats these failures as avoidable through deliberate planning.

---

## Outputs of This Step

The outcome of this step should be a **documented retirement or deprecation plan**, typically captured using the **System Retirement Record** in `/design-artifacts`.

At minimum, this output should include:

- rationale for retirement or deprecation
- timeline and transition plan
- responsibility and approval record
- data and record-handling decisions
- post-retirement evaluation and learning notes

These records support transparency, accountability, and future design quality.

---

## Relationship to the Capability Lifecycle

Retirement and deprecation close the capability lifecycle by:

- preventing legacy systems from undermining current values
- ensuring accountability does not end with system use
- enabling institutions to adapt responsibly over time

Well-designed retirement strengthens trust rather than eroding it.

---

## Practical Guidance

When planning system retirement:

- normalise retirement as responsible design practice
- plan for it early, even if it is years away
- prioritise capability continuity over technical continuity
- preserve evidence needed for accountability

Ending systems well is as important as building them well.

---

## Summary

This step ensures that Capability-Driven Development produces systems that:

- can be withdrawn without loss of responsibility
- do not accumulate unmanaged legacy risk
- support long-term institutional learning

Responsible systems have a beginning, a life, and a deliberate end.

## Method Complete

This document completes the Capability-Driven Development method.

Designers and institutions should now return to:
- **capability intent**
- **evaluation findings**
- **future design needs**

and apply the method iteratively to new systems and contexts.
