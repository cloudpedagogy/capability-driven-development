# Foundations

This directory contains the **conceptual foundations** of Capability-Driven Development (CDD).

These documents explain **why CDD exists**, **what it applies to**, and **how it should be interpreted**, before introducing the method, patterns, or examples.

They are intended to be read first by anyone new to CDD.

---

## Purpose of the Foundations

The foundations clarify:

- the motivation and scope of Capability-Driven Development
- its relationship to the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework
- the core principles that guide its application
- the boundaries of what CDD does and does not attempt to do

Together, they establish the conceptual constraints that underpin the rest of the repository.

## Contents

- **`00-purpose-and-scope.md`**  
  Explains why Capability-Driven Development exists and where it is intended to be applied.

- **`01-relationship-to-ai-capability-framework.md`**  
  Clarifies how CDD complements the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework and distinguishes the roles of each.

- **`02-core-principles.md`**  
  Sets out the non-negotiable design principles that guide the CDD method, patterns, and examples.

- **`03-what-cdd-is-not.md`**  
  Defines the boundaries of CDD to prevent misinterpretation or misuse.

## How to Read These Documents

The foundations are designed to be read in order:

1. Purpose and scope  
2. Relationship to the AI Capability Framework  
3. Core principles  
4. What CDD is not  

They do not introduce procedural steps or technical guidance.

Readers seeking *how* to apply CDD should continue to:
- `/method` for the design process
- `/patterns` for reusable design solutions
- `/examples` for applied illustrations

---

## Summary

The foundations ensure that Capability-Driven Development is:

- applied deliberately rather than mechanically
- understood as a design approach, not a framework or checklist
- grounded in responsibility, judgement, and governance

Everything else in this repository builds on these foundations.
