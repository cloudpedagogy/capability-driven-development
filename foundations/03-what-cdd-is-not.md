# What Capability-Driven Development Is Not

_Status: Draft_

---

## Purpose of This Document

Capability-Driven Development (CDD) is deliberately positioned between ethics, governance, and software design.

Because it sits at this intersection, it is at risk of being misunderstood, overextended, or misapplied.

This document clarifies what CDD **is not**, in order to:
- prevent category errors
- maintain conceptual clarity
- protect the integrity of the approach
- support responsible use

CDD is intended to be applied with judgement, not treated as a universal solution.

---

## CDD Is Not a Framework

CDD is **not** a conceptual or evaluative framework.

It does not:
- define maturity levels
- classify organisational capability
- provide diagnostic scoring
- offer a comprehensive taxonomy

Those functions are served by the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework**.

CDD assumes the framework and translates its requirements into system design decisions.

---

## CDD Is Not a Compliance or Certification Scheme

CDD is **not** a compliance checklist, regulatory standard, or certification process.

It does not:
- guarantee legal compliance
- certify systems as “ethical” or “safe”
- replace institutional policy or governance
- produce audit-ready artefacts by default

CDD supports defensible design, but it does not automate assurance or accountability.

---

## CDD Is Not a Software Development Methodology

CDD is **not** a replacement for:
- agile, waterfall, or hybrid methodologies
- DevOps or MLOps practices
- software engineering lifecycles

It does not prescribe:
- sprint structures
- tooling choices
- delivery timelines
- development roles

CDD constrains *what should be built* and *how responsibility is preserved*, not *how code is written*.

---

## CDD Is Not a Technical Architecture or Pattern Library

CDD does **not** define:
- reference architectures
- system blueprints
- technical stacks
- model selection strategies

The design patterns in this repository are:
- capability-oriented
- technology-agnostic
- structural rather than technical

They must be instantiated through appropriate engineering practices.

---

## CDD Is Not Prompt Engineering or Tool Guidance

CDD is **not** concerned with:
- crafting prompts
- tuning models
- selecting APIs
- optimising performance metrics

While AI tools may be used within CDD-designed systems, CDD itself focuses on **system-level design**, not interaction-level optimisation.

---

## CDD Is Not a Substitute for Human Judgement

CDD does not remove the need for:
- professional expertise
- ethical reasoning
- institutional decision-making
- contextual interpretation

It cannot:
- resolve value conflicts
- determine acceptable risk
- replace governance bodies
- make decisions on behalf of organisations

CDD supports judgement; it does not replace it.

---

## CDD Is Not Universal or Context-Free

CDD is not appropriate for:
- purely technical systems with no decision relevance
- low-risk automation with no accountability implications
- contexts where human judgement is genuinely unnecessary

Applying CDD where it is not needed may:
- add unnecessary complexity
- obscure responsibility
- dilute its effectiveness where it matters most

---

## Why These Boundaries Matter

These distinctions are essential to ensure that:

- CDD is applied where it adds value
- responsibility remains human and visible
- the AI Capability Framework and CDD remain complementary
- systems are not given false legitimacy through misuse

Respecting what CDD is *not* is as important as understanding what it is.

---

## Summary

Capability-Driven Development is a **focused, practical design approach** for AI-enabled systems that must remain responsible, governable, and defensible.

It is not a framework, methodology, or compliance tool.

CDD exists to shape **how systems are designed**, not to replace the judgement of those who design and govern them.
