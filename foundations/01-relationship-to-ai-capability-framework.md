# Relationship to the AI Capability Framework

_Status: Draft_

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document explains how **Capability-Driven Development (CDD)** relates to the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework**, and why the two are intentionally distinct but interdependent.

Its purpose is to:

- prevent confusion or overlap between the Framework and CDD
- clarify when and why CDD should be used
- establish clear conceptual and practical boundaries
- support consistent interpretation by contributors and users

This document should be read before applying the CDD method in practice.

## The AI Capability Framework: Defining *What* Capability Is

The **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework** defines *what* responsible, effective AI capability looks like for individuals, teams, and institutions.

It provides a **normative reference model**, organised across six domains:

- AI awareness and orientation  
- Human–AI co-agency  
- Applied practice and innovation  
- Ethics, equity, and impact  
- Decision-making and governance  
- Reflection, learning, and renewal  

The Framework supports:

- sense-making and shared language  
- capability assessment and reflection  
- governance and ethical reasoning  
- strategic and educational alignment  

Crucially, the Framework is **technology-agnostic** and **intentionally stable**.  
It does not prescribe tools, architectures, or implementation approaches.

---

## Capability-Driven Development: Defining *How* Capability Is Designed Into Systems

**Capability-Driven Development (CDD)** exists to address a different, but related, question:

> *How do we design and build software systems that embody these capability requirements in practice?*

CDD is a **procedural design method** focused on the **application of the Framework** in system and software development contexts.

Where the Framework defines *capability expectations*, CDD defines:

- how capability intent is translated into design constraints  
- how human–AI boundaries are specified before automation  
- how governance, accountability, and oversight are built into systems  
- how systems are evaluated, adapted, and retired responsibly  

CDD is therefore concerned with **design order, decision points, and system behaviour**, not with defining capability itself.

---

## The Conceptual Relationship (Explicit and Intentional)

The relationship between the two is deliberate and stable:



**AI Capability Framework**  
→ defines **WHAT** responsible AI capability is


**Capability-Driven Development**
→ defines **HOW** to design and build systems that embody that capability




This distinction is foundational and should not be blurred.

---

## Key Principles Governing the Relationship

### 1. CDD Does Not Replace the AI Capability Framework

CDD does not redefine, reinterpret, or supersede the Framework.

All capability concepts used in CDD are derived from — and constrained by — the AI Capability Framework.

---

### 2. CDD Assumes the Framework

CDD assumes that users have:

- engaged with the AI Capability Framework  
- reflected on relevant capability domains  
- identified the capability context in which a system is being designed  

CDD should not be applied in isolation from the Framework.

---

### 3. The Framework Can Be Used Without CDD

The AI Capability Framework is designed to support:

- education and professional development  
- governance and policy discussions  
- assessment and reflection  
- strategic planning  

These uses do **not** require system or software development.

CDD is only relevant where **systems are being designed or built**.

---

### 4. CDD Should Not Be Used Without the Framework

Using CDD without reference to the AI Capability Framework risks:

- treating capability as a technical property  
- embedding automation without ethical grounding  
- prioritising efficiency over judgement and responsibility  

CDD relies on the Framework to define *what must be preserved* as systems evolve.

---

## Why the Two Are Kept Separate

The Framework and CDD are kept separate to ensure:

- conceptual clarity  
- reuse across contexts  
- long-term stability of the Framework  
- flexibility in how CDD evolves  

If the two were merged:

- the Framework would become overly procedural  
- CDD would become overly abstract  
- users would struggle to know which parts apply to their context  

Separation is therefore a design decision, not an accident.

---

## Practical Implications for Users

In practice, this means:

- **Use the AI Capability Framework** to assess, reflect, and agree on capability priorities  
- **Use Capability-Driven Development** when designing or building AI-enabled systems  
- **Use both together** when capability decisions must be translated into software behaviour  

CDD provides a disciplined way to ensure that systems do not quietly undermine the capability principles they were intended to support.

---

## Implications for Contributors

Contributors to this repository should:

- treat the AI Capability Framework as authoritative  
- avoid redefining capability concepts within CDD documents  
- focus contributions on design process, patterns, and application  
- maintain the WHAT / HOW separation consistently  

Any proposed changes that blur this boundary should be treated as a design risk.

---

## Summary

The AI Capability Framework and Capability-Driven Development form a coherent pair:

- the Framework defines **capability intent**
- CDD defines **capability-aligned system design**

Together, they support responsible, governable, and future-ready use of AI — without collapsing ethical judgement into technical implementation.
