# Design Artifacts

This directory contains **practical design artifacts** used to apply **Capability-Driven Development (CDD)** in real system design contexts.

These artifacts support **thinking, discussion, and judgement** when designing AI-enabled systems.  
They are not specifications, checklists, or compliance documents.

Their purpose is to help teams design systems that remain **responsible, governable, and defensible** over time.

---

## What These Artifacts Are

The design artifacts are:

- lightweight, human-centred design tools  
- capability-first rather than technology-first  
- usable in workshops, reviews, and live projects  
- appropriate for education, research, and public-interest systems  
- intentionally incomplete and revisable  

They help make **assumptions, boundaries, and responsibilities explicit** before they become embedded in systems.

---

## What These Artifacts Are Not

These artifacts are **not**:

- compliance paperwork  
- policy documents  
- technical specifications  
- maturity models or scoring tools  
- replacements for professional judgement  

Completing an artifact does not imply approval or correctness.  
Their value lies in **the conversations they enable**, not in their completion.

---

## How the Artifacts Relate to Capability-Driven Development

Each artifact corresponds to a stage in the CDD method.

They are designed to be used **in sequence**, but not rigidly.

| CDD Design Focus | Artifact |
|------------------|---------|
| Capability intent | `system-capability-brief.md` |
| Human–AI boundaries | `human-ai-boundary-map.md` |
| Ethics, equity, and risk | `ethics-equity-and-risk-notes.md` |
| Governance and oversight | `governance-and-oversight-plan.md` |
| Evaluation and learning | `evaluation-and-learning-log.md` |
| Retirement and transition | `retirement-and-transition-notes.md` |

Artifacts should be revisited as systems evolve.

---

## Using the Artifacts in Practice

These artifacts are most effective when used:

- **early**, before technical decisions are locked in  
- **collaboratively**, rather than in isolation  
- **iteratively**, not as one-off exercises  
- **proportionately**, based on system risk and impact  

Not all artifacts need to be fully completed for every system.

Partial completion is normal and expected.

---

## Relationship to Other Repository Components

The design artifacts sit between **conceptual guidance** and **applied systems**.

- They apply principles from `/foundations`
- They operationalise the steps in `/method`
- They draw on reusable solutions from `/patterns`
- They are illustrated by `/examples`

Together, these components form a coherent capability-driven design system.

---

## Governance and Responsibility

Use of these artifacts does not transfer responsibility to templates or processes.

Responsibility remains with:
- designers
- developers
- institutional roles
- governance bodies

The artifacts exist to **support responsible decision-making**, not to automate it.

---

## Status and Evolution

These artifacts are expected to evolve through use.

They may be:
- adapted to local context
- simplified or extended
- revised as understanding improves  

Significant changes should be documented to preserve learning and traceability.

---

## Summary

The design artifacts exist to support one core aim:

> **Design AI-enabled systems that strengthen human and institutional capability rather than erode it.**

If an artifact helps clarify responsibility, it is working.  
If it obscures judgement, it should be revised or discarded.
