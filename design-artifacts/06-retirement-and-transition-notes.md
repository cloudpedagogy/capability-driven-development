# Retirement and Transition Notes

_Status: Draft_

---

## Purpose of These Notes

This document records **how an AI-enabled system may be responsibly retired, replaced, or transitioned**.

It exists to ensure that:
- systems do not outlive their justification
- responsibility does not silently dissolve at end-of-life
- transitions preserve institutional memory and capability
- withdrawal or replacement is treated as a design outcome, not a failure

Not all systems will reach retirement.  
All systems should be **designed with the possibility in mind**.

---

## System Context

**System name:**  
*(As per the System Capability Brief)*

**Context of use:**  
*(Education, research, public service, professional practice, etc.)*

**Primary capability intent:**  
*(Restated briefly from the Capability Brief)*

---

## Anticipated System Lifespan

What assumptions exist about how long this system is expected to operate?

Consider:
- temporary or pilot use
- fixed-term deployment
- open-ended use with periodic review
- dependency on external technologies or data sources

Explicit lifespan assumptions support responsible planning.

---

## Triggers for Review or Retirement

Under what conditions should the system be reconsidered, limited, or retired?

Examples:
- capability intent no longer applies
- ethical or equity risks increase
- governance or oversight becomes impractical
- superior alternatives emerge
- institutional priorities change
- system use drifts beyond original scope

Triggers may be qualitative as well as technical.

---

## Transition Scenarios

If the system is retired or replaced, what transitions may be required?

Consider:
- transfer of responsibility back to human processes
- migration to a redesigned system
- discontinuation without replacement
- archival of outputs or records
- communication with affected users or stakeholders

Transitions should be planned to avoid sudden loss of capability.

---

## Preservation of Capability and Learning

What should be preserved when the system ends?

Examples:
- design rationale
- governance decisions
- lessons learned
- evaluation insights
- patterns that proved effective or ineffective

Preserving learning prevents institutional amnesia.

---

## Risks of Abrupt Withdrawal

What risks would arise if the system were withdrawn without planning?

Consider:
- gaps in support or oversight
- loss of coordination or visibility
- confusion about responsibility
- erosion of trust

These risks justify proactive transition planning.

---

## Responsibility for Retirement Decisions

Who is responsible for:
- initiating retirement discussions?
- approving withdrawal or transition?
- overseeing communication and handover?

Explicit responsibility prevents abandonment.

---

## Relationship to Other Design Artifacts

These notes:
- close the lifecycle defined in the **System Capability Brief**
- respond to learning captured in the **Evaluation and Learning Log**
- rely on governance structures defined in the **Governance and Oversight Plan**
- reinforce boundary discipline from the **Human–AI Boundary Map**

Retirement is a continuation of responsible design, not its end.

## Review and Update

**Date created:**  
**Created by:**  

**Last reviewed:**  
**Review notes:**  

This document should be revisited:
- during major reviews
- when scope or risk changes
- when replacement options emerge

## Summary

These Retirement and Transition Notes exist to answer one final question:

> **If this system must end, how do we ensure responsibility, capability, and learning do not end with it?**

Designing for responsible endings is part of designing responsibly.
